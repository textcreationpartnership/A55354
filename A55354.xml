            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It's a truth known at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Benedict Odeſcalchi</hi> during his Cardinalſhip, often threw Purſes of Money <hi>in cognito</hi> into houſes of perſons in want. A Gentleman of <hi>Liege</hi> having been robb'd, and deſiring his aſſiſtance in his neceſſity, he gave him a Bill to receive 4000 Crowns, having firſt told him that he had ſeen him ſomewhere. The Gentleman thinking that he ſhould not be paid ſo great a ſum, preſented him the Bill to know whether his <hi>Eminency</hi> had not miſtaken in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it; he anſwered him, <hi>You will be readily paid it; and do not divulge what I have done, I wiſh I could do ſomewhat more.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot end this <hi>Paragraph</hi> of the remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> without naming that of <hi>Melphi</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for having brought forth <hi>Flavio,</hi> to whom is attributed the invention of the <hi>Sea-Compaſs,</hi> which ſhews Pilots the courſe they ought to ſteer, the place whence they come, and that whither they are going, and where they are According to the common Opinion, this <hi>Flavio</hi> of <hi>Melphi</hi> invented it the year of our Salvation 1300 It was called <hi>Bouſſole,</hi> from <hi>Buxus</hi> or <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeolus,</hi> becauſe thoſe of the Weſt put it at firſt in a Caſe of <hi>Box.</hi> The Sieur <hi>Faucher,</hi> Preſident of the <hi>Mint-concern,</hi> ſays, that it was called in <hi>France</hi> for above 400 years, the <hi>Marinotte.</hi> Some perſons, over-ſpeculative, think it may be preſumed to have been in uſe in the time of the Children of <hi>Noah,</hi> becauſe they had Iron, and the Load-ſtone proper to compoſe it, and the knowledge of the <hi>Mathematicks. Levinus</hi> and <hi>Pineda</hi> ſay, that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Pilots made uſe of it to go to the Iflands of <hi>Tharſis</hi> and of <hi>Ophir.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> notes, that <hi>Solomon</hi> having equipt a Fleet on the Coaſt of the <hi>Red Sea, Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre</hi> furniſht him with his Sea-men skill'd in the Art of Navigation. The <hi>Greek Poet</hi> writes, that the <hi>Pole</hi> was obſerved in Navigation in the

                  <p>See here a remarkable thing related by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew de Cheſne,</hi> in the Life of the Popes. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whilſt he was yet Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> having depoſed <hi>Gautier de Bruge. Cordelier</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Poitiers, Gautier</hi> in the bitterneſs of ſpirit, appeal'd to the future Council, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a promiſe to be made him, that at the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of his death, his Appeal ſhould be put into his hands; which was executed: his Body was carryed into the <hi>Cordeliers Church,</hi> where ſome Miracles have ſince been wrought. <hi>Clement</hi> coming to <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and knowing that <hi>Gautier</hi> had carried his Appeal with him, cauſed his Tomb to be opened to take it away; for this intent, he made an <hi>Archdeacon</hi> enter into it at Midnight, who found the Appeal in the hands of the <hi>defunct;</hi> which he could not poſſibly take from him, till he had firſt ſworn to reſtore it him, with the conſent of him that had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him. This being done, <hi>Gautier</hi> open'd his hands, and the Archdeacon taking the Appeal, gave it the Pope; but endeavouring to go forth of the Sepulchre, he found he could not ſtir, and ſaid there was ſomewhat which withheld him, till he had returned the Appeal into the hands of the Biſhop deceas'd: then he came forth with eaſe; and the Pope conceiving a reſpect for the dead, honoured from thenceforwards his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108170:30"/>and enricht his <hi>Tomb. Gautier</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, becauſe he was more inclined for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Bourges,</hi> than for him of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who conteſted for the <hi>Primacy</hi> of <hi>Aquitain. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> revok'd two <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Boniface</hi> paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France:</hi> under him there riſe a great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance betwixt the <hi>Vatican</hi> &amp; the <hi>Louvre. Boniface</hi> was ſo animated againſt the <hi>Gibelins,</hi> and thoſe of their Party, that he ſhew'd it openly in the perſon of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Genoa,</hi> on an <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wedneſday.</hi> Under the ſaid <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth, the Errours of the <hi>Beguines</hi> and <hi>Begards,</hi> or <hi>Begands</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> were condemned; and it is from thence that the word <hi>Bigot</hi> comes: theſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, under the Mask of Religion, with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and hypocritical countenance, play the good companions. <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth removing the <hi>Holy Sea</hi> to <hi>Avignon,</hi> tranſported thither the the <hi>Vatican Library;</hi> and <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth cauſed it to be carried back to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where it has continued ſince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> the Twenty firſt or Twenty ſecond, of the Town of <hi>Cahors</hi> in <hi>Quercy,</hi> Son of <hi>Arnaud d'Euſa,</hi> or <hi>Doſſa,</hi> a Cobler, was call'd <hi>James.</hi> The Propheſie was, <hi>De ſutore Oſſeo. Du Cheſne</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Holy Sea</hi> having been vacant two years and ſome days, and that the Cardinals not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the Creation of a Pope, they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to accept and receive him whom <hi>James d'Euſa</hi> Cardinal, Biſhop of <hi>Port,</hi> ſhould nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; which <hi>James</hi> ſeeing, he nam'd himſelf; and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108170:31"/>the Nomination was approved and confirmed by the Cardinals, fearing leſt they might have another that would leſs pleaſe them. Father <hi>Gautruche</hi> ſays this is a Fable, and that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals did not remit themſelves to his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to chooſe whom he thought fit, and that he did not name himſelf. It's a thing well known, that by the way of <hi>Scrutiny</hi> and of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it is deſcended under pain of Nullity of Election to chooſe a Mans ſelf. The way of Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny and of Acceſs both together, is the moſt practiſed; that of <hi>Inſpiration</hi> and of <hi>Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> are but rare, and little us'd: we call the way of Inſpiration. when all the Cardinals free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur to acknowledge and proclaim unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly one perſon for <hi>Pope.</hi> The way of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe</hi> is, when the Cardinals either at entrance into the Conclave, or tir'd with the length of it, refer themſelves to one or to many amongſt them, to whom they give the power in the name of all, to give a common Father to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. None of the <hi>Compromiſaries</hi> can give his voice for himſelf, but his Election will be void. Theſe three ways of Election contain many circumſtances and conditions. <hi>John</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Frejus,</hi> and ſome time afterwards Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Avignon.</hi> Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth made him Cardinal.

                        <hi>Turin</hi> in the Plain of <hi>Piemont</hi> on the Bank of the <hi>Po,</hi> is the capital City of the Dukes Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. <hi>Chamberry</hi> is of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and has a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Court of this Prince is very ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did; his Royal Highneſs holds it at <hi>Turin,</hi> where there is a great Gariſon. The Dukes new Palace is one of the fineſt of <hi>Italy;</hi> it is compoſed of four <hi>pavillions,</hi> with great piles of Lodgings joyning to it; and in a great Court is ſeen the brazen Figure of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> the Second, on a Horſe of Marble repreſented to the life. The old Palace flankt with four great round Towers, guarded with a large Trench,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108170:37"/>and which faces a large void ſpace, is embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fair Gallery filled with excellent Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, which repreſent the Chriſtian Princes, and the Genealogy of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The little Chariot, with ſix horſes in their harneſs, all cover'd with pretious Stones, is an Ornament; and many other Rarieties.</p>
                     <p>The Metropolitan Church called the <hi>Dome,</hi> dedicated to St. <hi>John,</hi> is the depoſitory of the holy face-cloath, on which we ſee imprinted the face and other parts of the body of the Son of God. The other Towns of <hi>Piemont</hi> are <hi>Vercelli, Suſa, Turée, Mondevis, Aſt, Carignan, Carmagnolo,</hi> St. <hi>Tas. Suſa</hi> is the firſt that is found at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of <hi>Italy</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Alps,</hi> ten leagues from <hi>Turin. Pompey</hi> eſtabliſhed there a Colony, which gives teſtimony of its antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It has paſſed for the Capitol of the ſmall Principality of the little King <hi>Coetius.</hi> This Country is fertile; Proviſions are cheap, and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſcarce, becauſe there is no Trade. <hi>Suſa</hi> which is in <hi>Perſia</hi> is more renowned than that before-mentioned, becauſe the great <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> who commanded from the <hi>Indies</hi> even to <hi>Æ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> an hundred twenty ſeven Provinces, and other Kings, have held there their Court. <hi>Piemont</hi> has two or three Rivers whoſe banks afford Gold; it is found divided into ſlender parcels called Threads: The way of gathering it is noted in a book intituled <hi>Converſations de l' Academie de l' Abbé Bourdelot,</hi> in the Chapter
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108170:38"/>of the <hi>Philoſophers Stone,</hi> which was the ſubject of a long Conference.</p>
                     <p>The principal Towns of <hi>Savoy</hi> after <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> are <hi>Anneci,</hi> St. <hi>John de Morienne, Monſtier in Tarentaiſe,</hi> and others: <hi>Montmebian</hi> is the ſtrongeſt place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Savoy</hi> was called by this name, as who would ſay, <hi>Sauve-voye,</hi> or <hi>ſafe-way;</hi> and this ſince it was purged of Way-Robbers and Murtherers, who rendered the ways dangerous and unpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable: or elſe from a Village called <hi>Sabbatie</hi> or <hi>Sabaudie,</hi> which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and other Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers place under the <hi>Alps.</hi> According to the opinion moſt followed, it took its name from <hi>Sabaudus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> who made it Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
                     <p>Its Mountains bring forth many <hi>Monkeys:</hi> Theſe Animals ſleep ſix months of the year; they have the muſſel and ears of a Squiril, and four long and ſharp teeth; the legs ſhort, great nails on their feet, and the hair rough. Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-ſweepers bring of them to <hi>Paris;</hi> they are eaſily taken when they are aſleep. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines call this Animal <hi>Mus Alpinus.</hi> There are a great many in the Mountains of <hi>Switzerland. Chateauniere deGrenaille</hi> tells us, that perſons that cannot ſleep, or that are tormented with the Cholick, find themſelves relieved by rubbing their belleys with their fat.</p>
                     <p>Many Mountaineers get Strumous ſwellings by drinking Snow-water, which by its crudity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108170:38"/>ill quality, cauſes the glandulous ſwelling about the throat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mount Cenis</hi> and little St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> are the principal paſſages of the <hi>Alps</hi> for <hi>Italy:</hi> Great <hi>Mount Cenis</hi> is the ordinary Road of the Poſts of <hi>France;</hi> and little <hi>Mount Cenis</hi> is a ſhorter way, but more uneaſie. We find there the invention of a ſort of Sled, on which a man ſitting, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in leſs than half a quarter of an hour a league, by ſliding on the Snow from the top of the Mountain to the bottom. There are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons trained to this exerciſe called Sled-drivers, who guide the Sled by ſtopping it when it is neceſſary, with a great Prong of iron, which they fix in the way. On the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there are houſes which they call the <hi>Ramaſs,</hi> where the Sled-drivers are, by whom men cauſe themſelves to be driven on a Sled when they go to <hi>Laſneburg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find on the right hand the Chappel into which thoſe perſons are carried who are killed by the extremity of the cold in their Journey, and on whom is found no mark of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. When perſons ſo killed are diſcovered to be Catholicks, they are buried in the next Catholick Church-yard: If they are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, they are carried into the next Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of theirs. Thoſe that go into this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, fancy they are in the Kingdom of the Dead; the Air is ſo ſubtile, that thoſe bodies do not putrifie; there are many of them entire, with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108170:39"/>their fleſh, skin, and hair, without having chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but a very little of their colour. They are placed in order upright againſt the walls of this Chappel, a place of ſadneſs and melancholy. <hi>Mount St. Gothard,</hi> which is the paſſage from <hi>Switzerland,</hi> has alſo a Chappel of perſons fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen to death: Our <hi>Lady of Laghette</hi> is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, two leagues from <hi>Nice.</hi> The greateſt part of the Tombs of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> are in the rich Abbey of <hi>Haute-combe,</hi> on the Lake <hi>Bourget.</hi>

                     <p>The Dominions of this Prince may be ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leagues in length, and thirty or forty in breadth; and in ſome parts above fifty. <hi>Spain</hi> would have ſwallowed them up in the minority of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> the Second; but <hi>France</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, made them give over the Attempt.</p>
                     <p>His Royal Highneſs has four houſes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure about <hi>Turin,</hi> which muſt not be forgotten to wit, that <hi>de la Grande Venerie Royal,</hi> that of <hi>Valentin,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Mirefleur,</hi> and of <hi>Rovili.

                     <p>At the beginning of the year 1679, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>d' Eſtrade</hi> at his return from his Embaſſie from <hi>Venice,</hi> where he reſided three years, was ſent to this Court with the Character of Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of <hi>France:</hi> his entry was very ſolemn.

                     <p>The Ratification of the Marriage of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> with the Infanta of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was at <hi>Lisbone</hi> the 18th of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1679.</p>
                     <p>The 19th of <hi>September</hi> following, the Sieur of the Red hat Deputy, and firſt <hi>Syndick</hi> of the Town of <hi>Geneva,</hi> accompanied with Sieur <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet</hi> and others, had Audience of Madam Royal, to give her ſatisfaction concerning ſome ſubjects of complaint that ſhe had made againſt that Town at the beginning of her Regency. He gave her to underſtand in a fine diſcourſe, how ſorry his Maſters were for all that had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that their intentions had never been to do any thing that was diſagreeable to ſo great a Princeſs; and that they humbly ſuppli'd her to forget all that was paſt, by a motion of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, and to let them feel the effects of her good will towards them. He addreſſed himſelf afterwards to his Royal Highneſs, and gave him to underſtand the deſire the Town of <hi>Geneva</hi> had to merit his good will, and the part they took in the glory that the Prince acquired by his Marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of ſo great a Kingdom.

                  <p>THis Prince came into the world the firſt day of <hi>November,</hi> 1661. The King has enlightned the ſteps of his youth, and has given him a meet Education, and inſpired into him, that he muſt never be Abſolute but in Reaſon and Juſtice. Theſe are the firm Pillars of a State. His Majeſty conſidering that it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the head of a publick Fountain, to corrupt the Soul of a Prince that may one day be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Throne; for this reaſon removes from his company Flatterers and Libertines, who might render obſcure the precious gifts and rare qualities which Heaven pours with full hands on this Royal Soul; which rejoyces <hi>France,</hi> which increaſes every day more and more, by the noble cares, by the high lights, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108170:49"/>by the incomparable Conduct of the Illuſtrious Perſons who have governed and inſtructed him. This Prince in his Orient is the admiration of the whole Court, of Ambaſſadors and of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Miniſters; and will be one day the Model of the greateſt Heroes. We ſee this Divine Plant to grow and riſe it ſelf every day to the admiration and glory of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Church. <hi>Anno</hi> 1668, Pope <hi>Clement the Ninth</hi> ſent into <hi>France</hi> Prince <hi>Loüis,</hi> Cardinal Deacon, Duke of <hi>Vendôme,</hi> Legat <hi>a Latere,</hi> to <hi>Loüis the Fourteenth,</hi> for the Solemnity and Ceremony of the Baptiſm of <hi>Monſieur le Dauphin.</hi> His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs was Godfather, and he was named <hi>Loüis Auguſt.</hi> This Prince has Married the Electoral Princeſs of <hi>Bavaria, Mary-Ann-Victoir-Chriſtian.</hi> People admire her Perfections, the excellency of her Underſtanding, her Majeſtick Air, the evenneſs of her Humour, and generally all the excellent qualities that ſhe poſſeſſes; which yet, as eminent as they are, are much beneath the Chriſtian Vertues wherewith her fair Soul is endowed. This great Princeſs will give her Spouſe Heirs to the Crown, and he in exchange will Crown her with Palms and Laurels. The Church and the State will gather the fruits of Glory and of Benediction. The 7th of <hi>March,</hi> 1680, Cardinal <hi>Boüillon,</hi> great Almoner of <hi>France,</hi> gave them the ſecond Benediction of Marriage at <hi>Chalons</hi> on <hi>Marn.

                  <p>THe Councels are compoſed of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour Keeper of the Seals of <hi>France,</hi> of the Marſhal <hi>Duke de Villeroy</hi> Chief of the Royal Council for the Kings Revenue, of Twelve ordinary Councellours of State, Three Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors of the Church, and Three of the Sword, Twelve attending every ſix Months. The King regulating the Councel, <hi>An.</hi> 1673. added the Controuler General of his Revenues, and the two Intendants of them, to have place in the Councels <hi>des Parties,</hi> as they have in thoſe of the Revenue.</p>
                  <p>The Councellours of State are choſen by his Majeſty, being ſuch as have paſt the greateſt part of all the Offices of the Robe, having been Intendants of Juſtice, or Ambaſſadors, or firſt Preſidents of the Parliaments; theſe are at preſent the beſt and moſt ſought-for Offices of the Kingdom, and which come neareſt the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108170:56"/>King, who gives ſuch perſons daily the beſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys, and Commiſſions of greateſt importance for the ſervice of himſelf and the State.

                  <p>The Illuſtrious Controller General of the Kings Revenues, of whom I have ſpoken before, may rely on the fidelity of theſe two Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>

Abbot Parfait,</hi> the ancienteſt Canon of this Church, has compoſed a fine Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the number of Popes, Cardinals, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Archbiſhops that this Metropolis has afforded, and other ſingularities ſince <hi>St. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> to Meſſire <hi>Francis de Harlay de Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valon.</hi> The late Dean, Meſſire <hi>John de Contes,</hi> Counſellor of State in ordinary, conſummated in the practice of the Church, has often gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this Dioceſs to the ſatisfaction of all men. He dyed full of years, the fourth of <hi>July,</hi> 1679. His moſt worthy Nephew, <hi>Abbot Mony,</hi> who walks in his ſteps, ſucceeded him as Heir to his Vertues: his Actions are accompanied with ſweetneſs, prudence, gravity, and modeſty.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108170:61"/>His Brother <hi>Abbot Bongueret,</hi> Canon in the ſame Church, is very learned in the Science of the Canon-Law. This Chapter is a Nurſery of Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>This City contains Eleven Chapters, a great number of very fair Pariſhes, whereof ſome are equal to good Biſhopricks; above ſixty Colledges: it was once propos'd to have them reduced to ſix, becauſe many of them are one-ey'd, ſo call'd, becauſe there is nothing done in them, as in many other Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>This Town contains alſo an infinite number of <hi>Religious Houſes,</hi> excellent Fountains, Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, many Bridges, amongſt which <hi>Pont-neuf,</hi> which is all of ſtone, ſurpaſſes all the reſt. We ſee in the midſt of it a Monarch, who was in three rang'd Battles which he gain'd, in thirty three Rencounters, in an hundred and forty fights, and in three hundred Sieges of ſeveral places; it's <hi>Henry the 4th,</hi> excellently repreſented on a Horſe of caſt Copper, and at the end of it the Clock of the fair Fountain of the <hi>Samaritan;</hi> and <hi>Loüis</hi> the Thirteenth, on another Horſe of caſt Copper, with excellent <hi>Deviſes</hi> on the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal, in the midſt of the <hi>Place Royal,</hi> which is one of its ornaments, with the Queens <hi>Tour.</hi> The <hi>Place Royal</hi> was begun to be built, <hi>Anno</hi> 1604. It's there where Coaches go the Tour, where they run the Ring, and uſe other publick Divertiſements. The new <hi>Hôtel Royal</hi> of diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled men, called otherwiſe the <hi>Hôtel</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:108170:62"/>as large as a Town, built for the place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and entertainment of Souldiers that are lamed and diſmembred in the Army, for the ſervice of the State, is a Monument of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and gratitude of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, and a ſubject of the great care that the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> has taken for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Work. The Fort of the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> for Aſtronomers is worthy conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Before that part of <hi>St. Germains,</hi> formerly called <hi>le Fauxbourg St. Germain des Prez,</hi> and others were taken into the Town, there were counted twenty four doors: that of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> is Royal, the figure of the King on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back is over the Triumphal Arch. The late <hi>Abbot de Bourzaix</hi> thought that the <hi>Deviſes</hi> of this great Monument raiſed in the honour of <hi>Loüis le Grand,</hi> ſhould have been Latine; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging, that the Latine Tongue is the Tongue of Religion, the Tongue of the Altar, and of the Holy Ghoſt, and many other reaſons. The Sieur <hi>Charpentier</hi> of the French Academy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another way, maintains that they ought to be in our Tongue, in his Book intituled, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe de la Langue Francoiſe pour l'inſcription de l'arc de Triumphe.</hi>

                  <p>We take always the Rector of the Faculty of Arts according to his ancient ſtanding. The Faculty of Divinity is compoſed of two pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schools; of that of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> and that of <hi>Navarre:</hi> the Sieurs <hi>Martin Grandin, Guillaume de l'Eſtocque, Gui Bouſt, Jacques de Perrier, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Pirot,</hi> and <hi>Michael Antoine Vincent,</hi> teach in the Colledge of <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> Maſter <hi>Martin Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> has dictated Divinity for theſe forty years.

The Religious Men and the Monks have their particular Profeſſors in their Houſes, which have alſo brought forth great perſons. The Seculars and Regulars are compared to two Beams, which uphold the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice of the Houſe of <hi>God.</hi> The Abbot <hi>Coque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> Doctor of the Houſe and Society of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> Canon of the Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> formerly Curat of <hi>St. Mederic,</hi> and Prior of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> was made Chancellour of the Univerſity in the Month of <hi>May</hi> of the year 1679. We promiſe our ſelves great things from him, by reaſon of his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Learning and rare Eloquence, whereof he has given, and daily gives manifeſt proofs, in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108170:63"/>the firſt Chairs of <hi>Paris.</hi> To raiſe the dignity of his Charge of Chancellour, and the merit of his Perſon, there is nought wanting to him but that he occupy for ſome time the Chair of the <hi>Louvre.</hi> Beſides his being a great Orator (which is a particular Talent) and a great School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he is alſo a great Hiſtorian, and skilful in the Oriental Tongues.

                  <p>ITs Provinces are worth Kingdoms: it's in <hi>France</hi> where we ſee the level Fields fertile in all ſorts of Grain, the Hills cover'd with Vines, pleaſant Meadows, beautiful Forreſts, fair O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-trees and Orange-trees, and all ſorts of Fruits.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108170:77"/>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Caſpian</hi> Seas, it was formerly propos'd at the Court of the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> to joyn theſe great Rivers together, the <hi>Volge,</hi> the <hi>Duinus,</hi> and the <hi>Dom,</hi> for the communication of the chief Seas of our Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.

It is known by tradition that <hi>Beza</hi> being come thither from <hi>Ganges</hi> to preach his new Doctrine, he was expelled by that Lord. The Lady of the place was ſeduc'd before, and the Inhabitants paſſionately deſir'd to hear him preach, becauſe it had been repreſented to them that he preacht nought but the pure Word of God, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Age, and that he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Preacher. <hi>Beza</hi> was already got into the Church <hi>de la Madelein,</hi> when the Baron came from his Caſtle accompanied with his

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Preſident of each Parliament wears on his Cap two Galloons of Gold, and three Borders of Gold likewiſe on his Mantle, lin'd with Hermines on the backſide to diſtinguiſh him from other Preſidents of the Cap, who have but one on their Cap.

A book entituled <hi>L'Etat de la France</hi> marks the Juriſdiction of all the Superiour Courts, and after what manner the Officers are cloath'd on ſolemn days.</p>
                  <p>There are counted in the Kingdom twenty three <hi>Generalities,</hi> about an hundred ſixty four <hi>Elections:</hi> There were counted three <hi>Chambers

                  <p>Theſe Chambers were inſtituted in favour of perſons of the pretended reform'd Religion, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the Edicts of Pacification made in the years 1576, 1577, and 1578.

By reaſon of theſe great Conqueſts it was deliberated in the <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for carrying the Keys of their Town to the King; of thirty ſix voices there were twenty ſeven. An ancient <hi>Burgomaſter,</hi> aſſiſted with eight perſons of the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, reverſt the Deliberation, and caus'd the Sluces to be drawn up.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108170:106"/>Burgomaſter into <hi>Spain</hi> with the Character of Embaſſadour; he excuſed himſelf on the account of the weakneſs of his age. <hi>M. le Prince</hi> drew very near <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and many perſons think that he had entred it, had it not been for the hurt he receiv'd in his hand at <hi>Tolhus,</hi> a place where the <hi>Rhine</hi> divides it ſelf, and where is built the famous Fort of <hi>Schenk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 23 of the ſame month and of the ſame year, the King put in poſſeſſion of the Seals Meſſire <hi>Etienne Deligre,</hi> and rais'd him the month of <hi>January, An.</hi> 1674. to the place and dignity of Chancellor of the Kingdom, for his merit and long ſervices rendred to the State.

That of the Eccleſiaſtical Electors is of Scarlet Cloath, and that of the Lay Electors is of <hi>Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Velvet.</hi> They are all lin'd with Hermines, as likewiſe their Cap. There are ſome of them to be ſeen drawn at large with their ceremonial Habits, in one of the faireſt and richeſt Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Duke Mazarin,</hi> formerly belonging to the Cardinal of this name. The <hi>King of Bohemia,</hi> inſtead of the Electoral Cap, wears a Royal Crown on his head.</p>
                  <p>You muſt obſerve, that <hi>An.</hi> 1673. the Town of <hi>Cologne</hi> was choſen to treat there of a Peace betwixt the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the Aſſembly was held at the Convent of the Carmelites, a place very convenient. His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſent thither for his Plenipotentiaries the Duke of <hi>Chaulne,</hi> and the <hi>Sieurs Courtin</hi> and <hi>de Baril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who arriv'd there the firſt; the King ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would not retard the work of Peace, where ſo many Princes concern'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though loaded with Victories. They were followed by three <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who had a deference of Honour from all the reſt, they being then in quality of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Two Plenipotentiaries came afterward
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:108170:137"/>from <hi>England,</hi> and they expected for third the <hi>Earl of Sunderland</hi> chief of the Embaſſie. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abſence Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> perform'd for him. Thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> came to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four, and afterward the Plenipotentiaries of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had no other quality but of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys.</hi> The <hi>Elector of Cologne</hi> had one Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, <hi>Prince William of Fuſtemberg;</hi> the <hi>Elector of Brandenburg</hi> ſent thither the <hi>Baron of Zmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin,</hi> who had a Colleague. The Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the <hi>Baron d'Iſola</hi> and others, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> ſent two there. He was one of the Parties concern'd. This Illuſtrious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly had no ſucceſs, becauſe the ſeizing and carrying away by force the perſon of <hi>Prince William of Furſtemberg</hi> by the Imperialiſts, though veſted with the character of Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary, in a place which ought to be a Sanctuary, oblig'd his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, conſidering the Laws of Nations violated, to recal his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nimegen</hi> was ſince made choice on for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Conferences of the general Peace.

                  <p>The 11th of <hi>August</hi> 1677. the Biſhop and Prince of <hi>Gurc</hi> chief of the Embaſſie of <hi>Germany</hi> for the Conferences of the Peace, arrived at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megen</hi> accompanied with Count <hi>Kinski,</hi> and with

He attacht alſo the Secular powers, maintaining that there muſt be no paying of Tolls nor Tributes, nor any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Subſidy, that all was common; and ſaid in his Sermons, that he had a Revelation from the holy Virgin.

                  <p>A Relation tells us, that his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Charles Loüis</hi> made an end of building, <hi>An.</hi> 1680. at <hi>Frederickbourg</hi> near <hi>Manſhein,</hi> one of the faireſt Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that he dedicated it to holy <hi>Concord</hi> or <hi>

The Ceremony began with a ſine Concert of Muſick, which was followed with an inaugural Oration very learned, and a learned Sermon of <hi>Doctor Fabritius</hi> his firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: in the afternoon he caus'd to preach there a <hi>Lutheran Doctor,</hi> and in the evening a <hi>Catholick Prieſt</hi> of the Church of <hi>Mayence:</hi> and all three freely heard each other on the laudable deſigne of his Electoral Highneſs. You muſt not admire at this diverſity of Preachers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſome places of <hi>Germany</hi> the ſame Church is common to Catholicks and Lutherans.</p>

                     <hi>Charlemagne</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was at <hi>Compoſtella</hi> to honour <hi>St. James,</hi> and caus'd his Church to be built. Since the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have been Catholicks, they have always honour'd him.</p>
